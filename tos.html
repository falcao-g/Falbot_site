				<h1>Falbot Terms of Service</h1>

				<h2>Up to date as of 04/03/2024</h2>

				<p>
					Please carefully read these Terms of Service (the "Terms") that govern
					and define your (the "User", "Users") access and usage of Falbot (the
					"Owner", "we", "us", "our") as well as associated services and
					applications (the "Service", "Services"). By accessing or using the
					Service, you understand and fully agree to all Terms stated in this
					document. Violation of these Terms may lead your loss of access to the
					Service. We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time
					without any prior warning, and it is the responsibility of the User to
					ensure they are up to date with changes to these Terms. We reserve the
					right to add or remove features, access, and functionalities from the
					Service at any time, and we may suspend or stop the Service
					altogether.
				</p>

				<p>Access to the Service is explicitly denied if Users are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Found to be in violation of the Terms</li>
					<li>Attempting to circumvent blocked access to the Service</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					The owner reserves the right to restrict or entirely terminate any
					User's access to the Service at any time, at our discretion, for any
					reason, regardless of whether it is stated in this document. We
					reserve the right to terminate and erase user account access and data
					at any time without prior warning.
				</p>

				<p>
					All transactions within Falbot are conducted using virtual currency, 
					which we refer to as "falcoins." falcoins have no real-world value and cannot 
					be redeemed for cash or any other currency. You cannot buy anything with 
					real money in Falbot, and we do not accept any payments for items or upgrades.
				</p>

				<p>
					Falbot offers a range of games that involve virtual gambling, such as horse race and roulette. 
					These games are designed for entertainment purposes only and do not involve any real-world currency. 
					However, some of these games may be illegal in certain jurisdictions or prohibited to users under 18 
					years old. By using Falbot, you acknowledge that you are aware of any local laws and regulations regarding 
					virtual gambling and that you will comply with them.
				</p>

				<p>
					While using our Service you may encounter content and media generated
					by other Users. We cannot be held liable for any effects or harm
					caused by the viewing or access of external content and user generated
					media. User-generated content that does not conform to the Guidelines
					will be removed and may lead to the suspension of the User's account.
				</p>

				<p>
					The "Falbot" trademark and all other media and assets associated with
					the Service are intellectual property owned by us and protected under
					law unless otherwise stated. Reproduction of content found on our
					Service is forbidden without our express written consent.
