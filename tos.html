				<h1>Falbot Terms of Service</h1>

				<h2>Up to date as of 19/01/2023</h2>

				<p>
					Please carefully read these Terms of Service (the "Terms") that govern
					and define your (the "User", "Users") access and usage of Falbot (the
					"Owner", "we", "us", "our") as well as associated services and
					applications (the "Service", "Services"). By accessing or using the
					Service, you understand and fully agree to all Terms stated in this
					document. Violation of these Terms may lead your loss of access to the

					without any prior warning, and it is the responsibility of the User to
					ensure they are up to date with changes to these Terms. We reserve the
					right to add or remove features, access, and functionalities from the

					altogether.
				</p>
