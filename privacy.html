				<h1>Falbot Privacy Policy</h1>

				<h2>Up to date as of 19/01/2023</h2>

				<p>
					We value your privacy and try to minimize the data we collect from
					you. This page is just here to let you know what information is stored
					so that the service can operate.
				</p>

				<p>
					No third-party tracking tools or cookies are utilized on our website.
				</p>

				<p>
					By creating an account or interacting with our applications, we
					collect information required for the service to operate. This is
					limited to information from Discord itself, mainly your Discord Id and
					username necessary for the application to function. All other pieces
					of information stored are generated when the user interacts with the
					Service (ex. Falcoins, rank).
				</p>

				<p>
					Users may request that their account be terminated and personal data
					be deleted by emailing us at falbot.oficial@gmail.com. Requests for
					account termination will be processed as soon as they are received and
					user data will be permanently erased within 30 days of termination.
					Also, if you and Falbot doesn't share a server anymore, your data will
					be deleted automatically.
